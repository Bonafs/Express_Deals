## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Get Actual Publishable Key
You need to get the corresponding publishable key from your Stripe dashboard:
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Copy the publishable key that starts with `pk_test_51RkmM8...`
3. Update the `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in settings.py

### 2. Run Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations subscriptions
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Create Test Subscription Plans
```python
# In Django admin or shell
from payments.models import SubscriptionPlan

# Create a basic monthly plan
plan = SubscriptionPlan.objects.create(
    name="Basic Monthly",
    description="Basic features with monthly billing",
    price=9.99,
    billing_interval="month",
    is_active=True
)

# Create Stripe product and price
plan.create_stripe_product_and_price()
```

### 4. Set Up Webhook Endpoint
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://express-deals.herokuapp.com/subscriptions/webhook/stripe/`
3. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `subscription.updated`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`
4. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 5. Create Frontend Templates
Create templates in `subscriptions/templates/subscriptions/`:
- `plans.html` - Subscription plans page
- `management.html` - User subscription management
- `payments/manual_payment.html` - Manual payment form
- `payments/success.html` - Payment success page

### Create Subscription (Python)
```python
from subscriptions.models import CustomerSubscription
from payments.models import SubscriptionPlan, StripeCustomer

# Get user's stripe customer
stripe_customer = StripeCustomer.get_or_create_stripe_customer(user)

# Create subscription
subscription = CustomerSubscription.create_subscription(
    user=user,
    plan=plan,
    stripe_customer=stripe_customer
)
```

### Process Manual Payment (JavaScript)
```javascript
// Create payment intent
const response = await fetch('/subscriptions/payment/create-intent/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: 25.00,
        description: 'Manual payment'
    })
});

const {client_secret} = await response.json();

// Confirm payment with Stripe
const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    elements,
    clientSecret: client_secret,
    confirmParams: {
        return_url: 'https://express-deals.herokuapp.com/subscriptions/payment/success/'
