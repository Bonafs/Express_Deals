🎯 CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION-READY FOR TRADITIONAL E-COMMERCE

The Express Deals platform IS ready for live customers and real transactions:
• Real payment processing with Stripe
• Complete order management system  
• User authentication and accounts
• Admin interface for product management
• Production security and scalability

However, it's designed as a TRADITIONAL E-COMMERCE PLATFORM, not an 
automated scraping/monitoring system.

🔄 TO CONVERT TO AUTOMATED PLATFORM:

You would need to add:
1. Web scraping modules (Scrapy, BeautifulSoup)
2. Task scheduling (Celery, Redis)
3. Real-time notifications (WebSockets, Django Channels)
4. Price monitoring algorithms
5. Inventory synchronization systems

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
Deploy the current platform for live customers first, then add automation 
features incrementally based on business needs.
